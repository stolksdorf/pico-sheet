For context, making a super simple app, just trying to read and write values to a simple sheet via the API

- I've enabled the proper libraries via the API manager on the dev console (https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library)
- The permissions on the Sheet have been set to 'everyone' and 'published'
- I have created an API key to use on the dev console under Credentials
- I can use this API key to do GET requests perfectly, but I'm getting 401 errors when trying to update the data via PUT requests
